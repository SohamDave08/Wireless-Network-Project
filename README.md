# WN mini project.

We have made a Publisher-Subscriber model using HiveMQ cloud under Node.js as a supporting technology.
Using this code one can connect their MQTT devices to HiveMQ's Cloud Native IoT Messaging Broker. 
Run the code to see the output.

### Supporting libraries used (Node.js):

-   MQTT
-   Twilio  (For SMS and Whatsapp bot)
-   Nodemailer (Mailing service)
